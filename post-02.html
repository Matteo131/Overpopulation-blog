							<h2>What will happen if there is wide increase in population</h2>

							<p>With population expanding at such a rapid pace, the world will eventually become overcrowded. This will lead to many rippling effect on global warming, deforestation or even oceans.</p>

							<p>These combined factors will accelerate the rate this problem shall approach, so it is one we need to begin to think of in the near future.</p>
							
							<p>We must invent solutions to fight this problem. These solutions include more technological advancement in the domain of the environment.</p>

							<p>The total population of the United States on April 1, 2020, was 331.4 million, an increase of 22.7 million from 2010. Last decade's 7.4% increase was lower than the previous decade's 9.7% increase and was, in fact, the lowest since the 1930s. If this tendence continues, it would have many effects mainly on the environment. We may invent new systems for the environment which will not be affectd by overpopulation<p>

							<h3> Main causes of overpopulation <h3>

								<h3>1. The decline of death rate<h3>

							<p style="font-size: 15px;">At the root of overpopulation is the difference between the overall birth rate and death rate in populations. If the number of children born each year equals the number of adults that die, then the population will stabilize.

							Talking about overpopulation shows that while there are many factors that can increase the death rate for short periods of time, the ones that increase the birth rate do so over a long period of time.

							The discovery of agriculture by our ancestors was one factor that provided them with the ability to sustain their nutrition without hunting. This created the first imbalance between the two rates.<p>

								<h3>2. The decline of death rate<h3>


							<p style="font-size: 15px">Following this the industrial revolution started. Technological advancement was perhaps the biggest reason why the balance has been permanently disturbed.Science was able to produce better means of producing food, which allowed families to feed more mouths. Besides, medical science made many discoveries, thanks to which they were able to defeat a whole range of diseases.
							Illnesses that had claimed thousands of lives until now were cured because of the invention of vaccines. Combining the increase in food supply with fewer means of mortality tipped the balance and became the starting point of overpopulation.<p>

								<h3>3. The decline of death rate<h3>

							<p style="font-size: 15px">However, when talking about overpopulation, we should understand that there is a psychological component as well. Poverty is considered as the leading cause of overpopulation. In the absence of educational resources, coupled with high death rates, which resulted in higher birth rates, that is why impoverished areas are seeing large booms in population. For thousands of years, a very small part of the population had enough money to live in comfort. The rest faced poverty and would give birth to large families to make up for the high infant mortality rate. Families that have been through poverty, natural disasters, or are simply in need of more hands to work are a major factor for overpopulation. As compared to earlier times, most of these extra children survive and consume resources that are not sufficient in nature. According to the UN, the forty-eight poorest countries in the world are also likely to be the biggest contributors to population growth. Their estimates say that the combined population of these countries is likely to increase to 1.7 billion in 2050, from 850 million in 2010.

								<h3>Solutions to fight climate change<h3>

								<p style="font-size: 15px">

								Have fewer children! One is good, two is enough 
								<br>
								<br>

								Consider adoption!
								<br>
								<br>

								Reduce your personal consumption: go vegan, limit flying, share your household with others, and more
								<br>
								<br>
								
								Spread your knowledge and concern among your friends and family, raise awareness about overpopulation on social media

							<p> Charles C.Mann worked for many years as a journalist specialised in sciences. He has always been intrigued by overpopulation and its rippling effects. Here is a quick video of his research.<p>
